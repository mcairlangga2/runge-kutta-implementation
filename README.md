# Runge-Kutta-Implementation
This repository is about implementation of runge-kutta method for solving ordinary differential equation. The programming languange used here is MATLAB. There are three kinds of runge-kutta method:
1. 4th order Runge-Kutta 
2. 5th order Runge-Kutta (Butcher's Method)
3. Adaptive RK45 Runge-Kutta (Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg Method)

For the 5th order and Adaptive RK45, the reference that I used can be accessed below:

Thank You.
